CODE:
let x = 5;
let y = x + 5;

IL (SSA form):
x0 = 5;
t0 = x0 + 5;
y0 = t0;

how do we know when registers are not needed anymore? maybe by liveness analysis? maybe we can tell in a scope what values "escape" the scope?

OPTIMIZATIONS:
- copy propagation: replace all uses of t0 with y0
- constant folding: replace x0 + 5 with 10
- dead code elimination: if y0 is never used, remove it (and recursively remove any instructions that only feed into it)

RULES:
- a register may only be assigned to once (SSA form)
